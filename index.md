# RDFlib
RDFLib is a pure Python package work working with [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/). RDFLib contains most things you need to work with RDF, including:

* parsers and serializers for RDF/XML, N3, NTriples, N-Quads, Turtle, TriX, Trig and JSON-LD (via a plugin).
* a Graph interface which can be backed by any one of a number of Store implementations
* store implementations for in-memory storage and persistent storage on top of the Berkeley DB
* a SPARQL 1.1 implementation - supporting SPARQL 1.1 Queries and Update statements

## RDFlib Family of packages
The RDFlib community maintains many RDF-related Python code repositories with different purposes. For example:

* [rdflib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) - the rdflib core
* [sparqlwrapper](https://github.com/RDFLib/sparqlwrapper) - a simple Python wrapper around a SPARQL service to remotely execute your queries
* [pyLODE](https://github.com/RDFLib/pyLODE) - An OWL ontology documentation tool using Python and templating, based on LODE.
* [rdflib-jsonld](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-jsonld) - an rdflib plugin that is an implementation of JSON-LD
